# RAID_2021_MRS_Fuzzing

This repository contains the Multi-robot system (MRS) benchmarks submitted to RAID 2021.

There are five benchmarks, revised from existing MRS workloads and implementations. Those workloads have been implemented and tested on ROS Kinetic installed on Ubuntu 16.04 version.

The experimental results can be found at: https://https://geleideng.github.io/

The five workloads are modified based on open-source MRS projects from real-world examples. The details can be found in the manuscript.
